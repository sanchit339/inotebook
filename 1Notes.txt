// redux(js lib) : -  management of the state all over the application 
// if the ui is not nice then ask someone to design the ui

// frequent login required just to login in one time { cant get whats the issue }

hookes and contexts to be done 

nodeman 
authentication 
bcrypt.js library for passwords

tokens are given for every login 
ex : - session token json web token 

jwd authentication its a json web token (secure communication  between client and server)

not every time the user will provide the user id and password he will provide the token to store

we use express to get the route done example (get ... post ... all that stuff)

mongoose is used to create the create schema 


the note section of backend contains CRUD operations


concurrently (use multiple interfaces (client and server))

hosting the both end point on the different servers (frontend and backend)
now change the global package.json scripts file {local host are different 3000 / 4000}

createing the context api for saving the state and the context


use of location hook for highliting the currnt page(NavBar) 

adding the icons through the fontawsome and using the " i " in the index.css

install the corse for requisting the api from direct through the browser at the backend

added the modal function from the bootstrap which gives the popup screen (and opend it through the js given in the document)
